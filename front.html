        <h1> My Name is Nour Mokdad </h1>
        <p> Based in Toronto, I am currently tutoring high school math at The Math Guru.I started off at the University of Toronto pursuing a computer science degree, until I stumbled upon a second-year entry program offered by the faculty of information. I am now in my third year studying what I love- the intersection of computer science, social sciences and humanities. Equipped with software development and design skills, I am passionate and looking forward to pursue both a creative and meaningful career.</p>
