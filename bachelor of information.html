            Anyone who knows me knows that I am <i>obsessed</i> with getting my nails done. 
            <div class="hover_img">
                 <a href="nails.html">Here are some more of my past designs.<span><img src="sparkle.jpg" alt="image" height="400px" /></span></a></div>
            This inspired my design for Project 0: The Me Mobile App (to design an application that demonstrates an aspect of my persionality).<p> My initial idea was an interactive <i>app</i> where a user can select nails (on a sketch of a hand) in any order to reveal the nail design. <div class="hover_img">
                 <a href="#">my original sketches<span><img src="sketch.jpg" alt="image" height="400px" /></span></a></div>
            What my initial idea ignored was the complexity of this app. If a user is able to select the nails in any order... then that leaves use with 5! = 120 different combinations/ways to reveal the final nail design. <p> Still, I implemented it. <p> twice.
